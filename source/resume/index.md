## Experience

### Software Engineer @ [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)

**July 2015 - January 2018**

Technical leadership of Dashlane's semantic analysis team, powering Dashlane's industry-leading form-filling capabilities.

Work on Dashlane's browser extensions (several million daily active users across all mainstream browsers):

- Port of Dashlane's browser extensions codebase from legacy Javascript to modern Typescript.
- Automation of the build and and staged deployment processes.
- Implementation of the new standalone extension architecture, allowing the browser extensions to fully function without a companion desktop app.

Full rewrite of Dashlane's semantic analysis engine:

- Port of a 100K LOC C++ codebase to test-driven, modular Typescript.
- Modern architecture: business logic and core algorithms expressed as pure functions, Flux-style state management, task scheduling leveraging advanced asynchronous constructs.
- The new engine was deployed across all platforms suported by Dashlane, as a Typescript module or an SDK embedded in native code depending on the environment.

### Semantics Analyst @ [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)

**July 2012 - July 2015**

Completion of a project making Dashlane's semantic analysis globalisation-ready:
- Conception of an architecture allowing to quickly bootstrap the support of new languages by using machine translation under human supervision
- Development of the supporting toolchain, used internally and by outsourced workers (Javascript, Python, Angular 1.x)
- Design and implementation of a new language detection algorithm.
- The number of supported languages grew from 2 to 8

Port of several internal tools from XUL to modern Javascript (Javascript, Angular 1.x)

Development of a Python toolkit facilitating everyday tasks and research projects around the semantic analysis engine's rule system.

### Semantics Intern @ [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)

**January 2012-July 2012**

Maintenance and R&D tasks around the semantic analysis engine's rule system.

## Education

### Master's Degree, Linguistics & Translation @ [Université Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/)

**2010-2012**

A graduate programme in translation with a strong focus on digital opportunities for language professionals.

My final dissertation was focused on ontology localisation in the context of semantic web technologies.
